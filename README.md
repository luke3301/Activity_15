# Activity 15

This is for submission of Activity 15, which is comprised of quatro file as well as an html document.
This repo is for holding the appropriate documents of Activity 15.
The data is from the various sources that were asked of us to use for the Activity 14 assignment.
There is no real plan besides to create a repo that fits everything that is being asked of it and holds all the appropriate documents.
The repo is pretty simple, the main documents for it are the README file, which has important information about the repo in it, there is also a qmd file of the Activity 14, and an html version of that file.
Also it says that I need a pdf file but I was told in class that an html file is fine so that is what I submitted.
